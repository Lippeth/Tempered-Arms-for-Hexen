Description             : A "Vanilla+" weapon overhaul for Hexen that tries to add a little more punch to the combat, adding alt fire attacks, a few new graphics, and reworked animations.

=================
* THE ARMORY *
=================

*Fighter*

-Hefty & Spike
	Replaces Spiked Gauntlets. Punches come from the left arm, while the right arm weilds the Hefty Sword designed by neoworm. Both Hefty and Spike function similar to vanilla in that the third hit is more powerful, with animations to reflect.

-Timon's Axe
	A combination of vanilla and Hexercise, primary fire swings the axe in one of three ways at random, and altfire is a shield bash, with a modified shield sprite by neoworm.

-Hammer of Retribution
	Primary fire is vanilla, with sprites by neoworm for certain frames. Altfire is a horizontal swing that releases four hammers that fall to the ground and explode.

-Quietus
	Identical to Hexercise, but projectiles rip through monsters. Still thinking of more ideas.

*Cleric*

-Mace of Contrition
	Functions almost identically to Hexercise. Swings in one of three directions, altfire is a shield bash. Shield sprite and modified widescreen sprites by neoworm

-Serpent Staff
	Primary fire works the same as vanilla, alt fire is a mace swing that's been charged by the staff's magic.

-Firestorm
	Same as vanilla, but with new animation. Altfire rains fire at close range. Code is based on the Hellstaff's rain pillar from Brutal Heretic RPG by Seidolon.

-Wraithverge
	Identical to Hexercise. Primary fire charges a wraith attack, while altfire releases a single blast.

*Mage*

-Sapphire Wand
	Animations based on Hexercise, primary fire functions the same as vanilla, altfire turns the wand around to charge when held, and thrusts forward with a close range magic attack, similar to Hexercise but with the wand instead of a hand.

-Frost Shards
	Primary fire is based on vanilla, but holding down fire shoots individual shards, similar to Hexercise. Altfire is a magic shield that absorbs incoming projectiles, but disappears quickly. Modified grimoire sprites by neoworm.

-Arc of Death
	Primary attack is a quicker version of vanilla, and altfire is a close range lightning attack that syphons green mana and to a lesser extent blue mana. 

-Bloodscourge
	Identical to Hexercise other than animation. Projectiles target monsters.

For all weapons that work identically to that of Hexercise, I plan to change them once I have a good idea of what I want to achieve. This project will be ongoing and everything is subject to change.
